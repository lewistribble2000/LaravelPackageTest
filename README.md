# Laravel Package Project
Laravel Weather from IP package test. Written with usability and not production in mind, to be used in production, some refactoring and extractions of API keys would be needed, as they're test keys provided by the company publically, they have been left in for usability.

If I had managed to find more time to work on the project, I would spend more time refactoring the data handling function in the WeatherController and probably move the majority of the code there into functions callable by the package to prevent the external work needing to be done
